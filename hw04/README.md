## Seun Ladipo HW04

This project includes

1. LEDtoggle.c 

	This file was created to operate an led light with the use of nmap and gpio manipulation.
	The fastest time I could toggle was around 400 ns. This is much faster than the fastest I could get in hw02 eaelier in this quarter.
	
2. Tux Files
	
	This file contains different rotated and unrotated pictures of Tux

3. NameFile.jpg
	
	This file contains a picture of text that has my name and a special message

Good start.  How fast would it toggle?
Good to see you LCD display working. More points once you've documented it.
